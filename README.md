Our project, the Fruit Analyzer, is designed with the aim to reduce the alarming increase in the rate of food wastage worldwide. This idea aligns with the UN's SDG of sustainable production and consumption. It consists of sensors which would scan the fruit to check the presence of any internal or external defects in it. Using Google technologies like AutoML and Cloud, the outcomes of the sensors would be linked and displayed to the user via an app. Placing this device in the markets would ensure that the defective fruits are taken for sustainable processing rather than ending up in the landfill.
